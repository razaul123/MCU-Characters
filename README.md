<p class="marvel">Full name: Anthony Edward Stark<br>
Species: Human<br>
Citizenship: American<br>
DOB: 29/05/1970<br>
DOD: October 2023<br>
Alias:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>The New kid</li>
        <li>Visionary</li>
        <li>Genius</li>
        <li>The American Patriot</li>
        <li>The Prodigal Son</li>
   </ul>
Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a <strong>billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the <em>Avengers</em>, and the former CEO of Stark Industries</strong>. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the <em>Ten Rings</em> in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as <em>Obadiah Stane</em> who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, <strong>publicly revealing himself as Iron Man</strong>.<br>
    
Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own <em>Arc Reactor</em> poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by <em>Ivan Vanko</em> who attempted to destroy his legacy. Due to their assistance in both these battles, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a <strong>consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology</strong> while he began a relationship with <em>Pepper Potts</em>. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the <em>Chitauri</em> and <em>Loki</em>. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the <em>Iron Legion</em> to safeguard the world and help him retire.<br>

The 2012 <em>"Mandarin"</em> terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding <em>Aldrich Killian</em> as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, almost losing Pepper Potts in the process. In the wake of the battle, Stark destroyed all of his armors with the <em>Clean Slate Protocol</em>. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on <em>HYDRA</em>, <strong>Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of <em>Wolfgang von Strucker</em> and acquiring Loki's Scepter</strong>.<br>

  Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by <em>Wanda Maximoff's</em> mind games, built <em>Ultron</em> with the help of <em>Bruce Banner</em> as a <strong>new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire</strong>. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost.<br>
  
After the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support <em>the Sokovia Accords</em>. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally <em>Captain America</em> when the latter began protecting the fugitive <em>Winter Soldier</em>, igniting <em>the Avengers Civil War</em>. <strong>The end result left the Avengers in complete disarray</strong>, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide <em>Spider-Man</em> into becoming a better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.<br>

  In 2018, when <em>Thanos</em> and <em>the Black Order</em> invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the <em>six Infinity Stones</em>, Stark, <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on <em>Titan</em> with the help of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the <em>Time Stone</em> for Stark's life. After the Snap, <strong>Stark and <em>Nebula</em> remained the sole survivors on Titan</strong>. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by <em>Captain Marvel</em>, who brought them back to Earth.<br>
  
In the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a daughter, <em>Morgan Stark</em>. <strong>When Stark discovered the key to travel through time, he rejoined the Avengers to undo the Snap</strong>, traveling back in time to retrieve the Scepter and then to regain the <em>Tesseract</em>. During the Battle of Earth, Stark heroically sacrificed himself to eliminate Thanos and his armies, who traveled through time to collect the Infinity Stones, saving the universe from decimation, and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered superheroes.</p>


<h3 id="war-machine">War Machine</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Machine"><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/7/77/WarMachine-EndgameProfile.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20190423174940" width="200" id="image-war"></a>

<p class="marvel">Full name: James Rupert Rhodes<br>
Species: Human<br>
Citizenship: American<br>
DOB: 06/10/1968<br>
DOD: still alive<br>
Alias:<br>
 <ul>
  <li>Rhoey</li>   
  <li>Iron Patriot</li>
  <li>Honey Bear</li>
  <li>Platypus</li>
  <li>The Patriot</li>
 </ul>    
Colonel James Rupert "Rhodey" Rhodes is an officer with the <em>United States Air Force</em> and liaison between the military in <em>the Department of Acquisitions and Stark Industries</em>, where he became close friends with Tony Stark. When Stark had been kidnapped by the Ten Rings, <strong>Rhodes personally led a mission to rescue his best friend</strong>. However, upon their return, Rhodes saw Stark moving away from developing his weapons for the military and soon discovered that he was instead focusing on becoming a hero known as Iron Man. Despite all of his fears for his friend's safety, <strong>Rhodes still joined Iron Man in bringing down Obadiah Stane's schemes</strong>, while trying to keep Stark's secrets, only for Stark to reveal them to the media himself.<br>
    
With Iron Man's identity known, Rhodes found himself under pressure from <em>the United States Congress</em> and the military to take possession of the armor for himself, something that he was against. However, as Stark's reckless behavior got even worse, Rhodes had no choice but to take <em>the Mark II armour</em> before handing it over to the military, with <em>Justin Hammer</em> upgrading it with his new weapons to rebrand Rhodes as <em>War Machine</em>. However, just when War Machine was being presented to the world, <strong>Ivan Vanko returned and attacked the Stark Expo with an army of <em>Hammer Drones</em></strong>, as War Machine teamed up with Iron Man to bring him down, resulting in Rhodes keeping the armor for himself, despite Stark's continued objections.<br>

 With his newest armor, Rhodes took on the identity of the <em>Iron Patriot</em> and worked directly for <em>President Matthew Ellis</em>, with a mission to track down the Mandarin. However, <strong>Rhodes had soon discovered that the Mandarin was in fact a ruse created by Aldrich Killian</strong> by hiring actor <em>Trevor Slattery</em> to portray the role, as Killian managed to capture Rhodes and steal the Iron Patriot Armor, as Killian's henchman, <em>Eric Savin</em>, then used it to kidnap President Ellis as part of his ongoing Mandarin ruse. Rhodes managed to free himself and teamed up with Stark to defeat Killian's army of <em>Extremis Soldiers</em> and save President Ellis before Killian could publicly execute him, as Rhodes also uncovered <em>Vice President Rodriguez</em>'s role in Killian's plan.<br>
 
As War Machine, <strong>Rhodes continued serving his country and assisted the Avengers with defeating Ultron</strong>, as War Machine played a key role in ensuring that the people of <em>Sokovia</em> were rescued before Ultron could cause mass extinction. However, Rhodes soon found himself in conflict with the Avengers as the debate over the Sokovia Accords led to Captain America and Iron Man disagreeing and War Machine choosing to side with the government in support of the Accords. As the conflict worsened, War Machine clashed with Captain America's allies while they tried to protect the Winter Soldier and expose the plans of <em>Helmut Zemo</em>, only for War Machine to be crippled as he had been inadvertently shot out of the sky by <em>Vision</em>.<br>

Having been given leg braces by Tony Stark to help him walk again, Rhodes had became disillusioned by the government and decided to disobey <em>Thaddeus Ross</em>'s orders and instead assisted Steve Rogers as they had learned of the impending invasion of the Mad Titan, Thanos and his Black Order. Once they traveled to <em>Wakanda</em> in order to protect the <em>Mind Stone</em> from Thanos, <strong>War Machine fought alongside his allies in their attempts to hold back the Black Order and their own army of <em>Outriders</em></strong>. However, as Thanos arrived himself, War Machine and the others were unable to defeat him as Thanos took the Mind Stone and caused the Snap, as War Machine had then watched on helplessly while trillions of lives were erased.<br>

Determined to undo Thanos' actions, <strong>War Machine joined the Avengers to <em>the Garden</em></strong>, as they discovered that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, prompting Thor to behead the Mad Titan. However, by 2023, the Avengers learned to travel through time and War Machine joined Nebula on a mission to take the <em>Power Stone</em> from <em>Morag</em> in 2014. Succeeding in the mission, the Avengers reversed the Snap, before then being attacked by a past version of Thanos and his entire armies of the Chitauri and Outriders. War Machine then joined his fellow heroes in battling Thanos until Tony Stark sacrificed his life to finally eliminate Thanos, as Rhodes stayed by his best friend's side during his final moments before attending his funeral.</p>

<h3 id="mrs-stark">Pepper Potts</h3>
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/8/86/F_153752.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20190806085706" width="200" id="pepper-stark">

<p class="marvel">Full name: Virginia Potts<br>

DOB: Febuary<br>
DOD: still alive<br>
Alias:<br>
<ul>
<li>Pinhead</li>
 <li>Pep</li>
 <li>Rescue</li>   
</ul>
Virginia "Pepper" Potts is the CEO of <em>Stark Industries</em>. Originally working as <strong>Tony Stark's personal assistant, she would take care of his schedule and perform any task he wished</strong>. During this time, Potts became good friends with Stark and soon, they had begun developing romantic feelings for each other. However, neither was able to act on these feelings, as they each feared that the other would not accept them.<br>
    
When Stark returned from captivity in <em>Afghanistan</em>, <strong>Potts was trusted enough by him to see his Iron Man suits and his workshop</strong>. She helped Stark defeat Obadiah Stane, who tried to kill Stark, by overloading the Arc Reactor, killing Stane. After Stane's death, Stark made Potts his new business partner, taking Stane's place. Believing his death was imminent, Stark stepped down as CEO and appointed her as his replacement. After Stark defeated <em>Whiplash</em> at <em>the Stark Expo</em>, both Potts and Stark finally admitted their attraction to each other and began a romantic relationship.<br>
During the crisis surrounding the Mandarin's terrorist attacks, Potts was kidnapped by Aldrich Killian and injected with <em>Extremis</em>. She was freed by Stark during the Battle on the Norco and went on to kill Killian herself. Stark cured her of the effects of Extremis, who temporarily gave up being Iron Man just for her.<br>

As the War on HYDRA began, <strong>the Avengers needed to be remobilized. Without <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> active to run the team</strong>, Stark took over, allowing Captain America to retain field and team leadership while he designed everything else, including creating new armors and rejoining the team himself as an active duty combatant. Sometime after the Ultron Offensive, he and Potts broke off their relationship, which affected Stark and left him wondering why he could not make it work while his father could.<br>

However, shortly after the Avengers Civil War ended, Stark and Potts resumed their relationship, where Stark eventually proposed to her. <strong>The two married following the Snap and had a daughter, Morgan Stark</strong>. The three of them resided on the Stark Residence until Stark departed for <em>the Time Heist</em>. Later, Potts joined the Avengers in <em>the Battle of Earth</em> as <em>Rescue</em>, wearing <em>the Mark XLIX armor</em>, when Thanos' forces invaded. After Stark died by her side, Potts was present at his funeral, where she set adrift Stark's first Arc Reactor onto a wreath into their residential lakeside.</p>

Obadiah Stane was the business partner of Tony Stark and a good friend of his father, <em>Howard Stark</em>. After Howard's death, <strong>Stane became interim CEO of Stark Industries until Tony took over officially shortly after</strong>. Stane's jealousy of the younger Stark led him to join forces with the Ten Rings to organize a failed attempt to assassinate him so Stane could become CEO once again. <strong>He further armed the Ten Rings with Stark Industries weapons</strong>, to facilitate their campaign in the war-torn <em>Gulmira</em>. When his involvement with terrorists was exposed by Pepper Potts, Stane created the <em>Iron Monger Armor</em> and attempted to kill Stark himself, leading to his own death.</p>

Harold Joseph "Happy" Hogan is one of <strong>Tony Stark's closest friends and his personal chauffeur</strong> who formerly worked as his personal bodyguard and <em>Head of Security of Stark Industries</em>. Hogan was almost killed during Aldrich Killian's War, which motivated Stark to get revenge on the Mandarin, who he believed was behind Hogan's injuries. After his recovery, Hogan continued to faithfully serve as Stark's friend and employee.<br>

Hogan oversaw <strong>Stark's mentorship over Spider-Man</strong>, aiding the young hero on his trip to <em>Germany</em> and acting as their liaison when Parker continued his superhero activities. Hogan, however, was irritated by the boy and avoided his duties with him. After Parker defeated Vulture to prevent the cargo in which Hogan kept certain valuable items to be transferred to the <strong>New Avengers Facility</strong> from getting hijacked, the young hero earned Hogan's admiration and respect.<br>

In 2023, Hogan was present at Stark's funeral, after he died during the <em>Battle of Earth</em>. The grief-ridden Hogan began working with May Parker, and helped Peter Parker fight the Elementals in Europe.</p>

<p class="marvel">Full name: Phillip J. Coulson<br>
Species: Human<br>
Citizenship: American<br>
DOB: 08/07/1964<br>
DOD: still alive<br>
Alias:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Rookie</li>
        <li>New Guy</li>
        <li>Son of Coul</li>
        <li>Boss</li>
   </ul>
Phillip J. "Phil" Coulson was a former <em>Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>, before that one of its best agents and <em>Nick Fury</em>'s right-hand man for many important missions. He served as the primary operative in the <em>Avengers Initiative</em> following a <strong>Skrull Invasion on Earth in the 1990s</strong>, which led to the surfacing of <em>Captain Marvel</em>. Coulson also ran ground interference, surveillance and tactical operations in <em>Puente Antiguo, New Mexico</em> as part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigation surrounding the incident with <em>Thor</em> and <strong>the Destroyer</strong>. He was also the primary S.H.I.E.L.D. operative in the investigation into Stark Industries.<br>

During the Attack on the Helicarrier, <strong>Coulson was killed by Loki</strong>. His death gave the Avengers the push they needed to band together and stop the <strong>Chitauri invasion</strong>. On Fury's orders, Coulson was brought to the Guest House, a secret facility where he was brought back to life using treatments developed by <em>Project T.A.H.I.T.I.</em>, <strong>a project which he had formerly presided over</strong>. To preserve his sanity after he was healed, all memory of these events were removed from his mind.<br>

Coulson returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. to lead a new team to investigate the cases S.H.I.E.L.D. had not yet classified. While on this team, Coulson discovered the truth about the events after his death. During the <em>HYDRA Uprising</em>, despite the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the betrayal of <em>Grant Ward</em>, <strong>he led his team against the forces of HYDRA</strong>, attempting to stop <em>John Garrett</em>, winning the final battle in which Garrett was ultimately defeated. After the battle, <strong>Nick Fury appointed him the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.</strong>, ordering him to rebuild the organization from scratch.<br>

To perform that task, Coulson led the remains of S.H.I.E.L.D. in many battles against HYDRA, crippling the terrorist organization. He even made some contacts with the <strong>United States Air Force via Glenn Talbot</strong>. However, he became a <strong>fugitive when another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D., led by <em>Robert Gonzales</em>, attacked and occupied his base</strong>. Now accompanied by only a few loyal friends, Coulson started a battle to reclaim S.H.I.E.L.D. He eventually made a deal with Gonzales, and they worked together against HYDRA, finally reunifying the two factions into one organization with Coulson as its rightful director. However, a new threat soon arose, <strong>the Inhumans led by <em>Jiaying</em></strong>. In the ensuing conflict, both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Inhumans suffered casualties, and even Coulson paid an extreme price to achieve victory, <strong>having his left arm cut off</strong>. But even that loss did not stop him, and he started a new project that would ensure the safety of humanity.<br>

The mission of recruiting Inhumans for the team became more difficult, as <strong>the Advanced Threat Containment Unit led by <em>Rosalind Price</em></strong>, was dealing with the threat of the new Inhumans. However, Coulson had a relationship with Price while facing the threats of <strong>Ward's HYDRA, Lash and the Inhumans</strong>. After Ward killed Price, Coulson followed him to the planet <em>Maveth</em> and killed him to avenge all the people that he had murdered. As he thought that Gideon Malick was the last remaining leader of HYDRA, Coulson discovered that the <em>Hive</em> had returned to Earth from Maveth, using Ward's body as a host. With Malick's death, Coulson, with feelings of guilt for causing this threat, invested efforts to prevent Hive from accomplishing his plan to change <strong>all Humans to Inhumans and to control all of them</strong>. Once <strong><em>Lincoln Campbell</em> had sacrificed himself to kill Hive and saved humanity</strong>, the directorship of S.H.I.E.L.D. passed to <em>Jeffrey Mace</em>, while Coulson and Alphonso Mackenzie conducted a pursuit after the former agent turned vigilante Daisy Johnson.<br>

With the revelation of <strong>Lucy Bauer and her ambition to find the Darkhold</strong>, Coulson created an alliance with Johnson and <em>Ghost Rider</em> to find the book before the ghost did. He was caught in an explosion with Ghost Rider and Leo Fitz by Eli Morrow and almost sank into another dimension but managed to get out with help from <strong>Holden Radcliffe and Aida</strong>. Coulson then led the last fight against Morrow. Following the revelation that Mace was not actually an Inhuman, Coulson returned to the position of Director de facto while Mace remained de jure Director. <strong>Continuing fighting the <em>Watchdogs</em> led by Anton Ivanov who targeted him</strong>, Coulson was kidnapped by Holden Radcliffe, replaced by an LMD and put inside the Framework, where he lived as a history teacher. With the help of Johnson and Jemma Simmons, Coulson escaped the Framework, only to face against the threat of Aida to the real world.<br>

After he killed her, by <strong>temporarily bonding with the Spirit of Vengeance</strong>, Coulson and the others were sent to the year <strong>2091, when Earth had been destroyed and the surviving humans were enslaved by the <em>Kree</em></strong>. He and the other agents eventually made it back to the present day, although Coulson revealed that he was dying from his old injury due to his deal with the Spirit of Vengeance. In order to learn more about the Destruction of Earth, Coulson was imprisoned by Hale, who not only revealed that HYDRA still existed under her leadership, but also that there was an impending alien invasion. Following his escape, S.H.I.E.L.D. entered into a conflict with the Confederacy, but as he was trying to negotiate with them, Talbot turned to villainy. Coulson aided in defeating Talbot in the Battle of Chicago and stopped him from amassing the planet's Gravitonium, successfully averting the destruction of Earth.<br>

Coming to peace with the terms of his impeding death, Coulson retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. and lived out his remaining days in Tahiti with Melinda May, eventually succumbing to his illness.</p>

   </ul>
Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury is a <strong>world-renowned spy, former Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and founder of the Avengers</strong>. Fury began his career within the <em>United States Army</em> in the late 1960s, rising to the rank of Colonel before his honorable discharge. He later became a <strong>CIA operative during the Cold War</strong>, primarily operating in Soviet territory. Continuing to serve the world, Fury joined <em>S.H.I.E.L.D</em>. to fight against Earth's most dangerous enemies. The great scope of enemies widened in the 1990s as Fury met Vers, helping her uncover her human heritage as <em>Carol Danvers</em>, as the two fought off the <em>Starforce</em>, which was led by <em>Yon-Rogg</em>, as they were targeting Skrull refugees. <strong>Fury took a liking to Goose who scratched him for violating her space and permanently blinded Fury's left eye</strong>. Fury kept the reason for this injury secret, telling others it was classified but happened in the line of duty, while Danvers had then left the Earth in order to find a new home for the Skrulls and protect the rest of the universe.<br>

Later <strong>promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. by <em>Alexander Pierce</em></strong>, Fury refocused his efforts over the next 15 years to organize <em>the Avengers Initiative</em>, with Fury's true intentions were to bring together any other powerful individuals to assist S.H.I.E.L.D. with protecting the Earth from extraterrestrial threats, which he had only learned of following his encounters with the Kree and Skrulls. Despite some more considerable reluctance from <em>World Security Council</em> who had not believed in his theories, Fury had still continued his efforts and eventually <strong>managed to recruit both Iron Man and Captain America</strong> into their Initiative, ready for an incoming invasion.<br>

With the Avengers ready, Fury was forced to call them all into action when the Earth was invaded by <em>Loki</em>, who managed to brainwash an army and steal the Tesseract. With the Avengers assembled, Fury took charge of the hunt for Loki, leading the volatile team through the mission as they attempted to learn what Loki's plan for the Tesseract was and who he had been working for. This all then came to a head following <strong>Loki killing Phil Coulson</strong>, before being tracked to New York City. There, all the Avengers engaged Loki and his entire incoming army of Chitauri in a final battle, with Fury keeping the World Security Council from nuking the entire city before Loki was defeated and the Avengers were disassembled.<br>

Following the Avengers's victory, <strong>Fury recruited Captain America as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent</strong>, while Fury worked on the new <em>Project Insight</em>, as a means of accurately predicting threats; something which conflicted with Rogers' ideals. However, when Fury began to suspect that something was wrong with Project Insight, he then found himself becoming a target of the <em>Winter Soldier</em>, <strong>forcing Fury to fake his own death and go into hiding</strong>. With limited people he could trust, Fury then turned to Captain America along with <em>Black Widow</em>, the <em>Falcon</em> and <em>Maria Hill</em> to lead the fight, as he soon discovered that <strong>HYDRA had secretly managed to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. and Alexander Pierce was the leader</strong>, as Captain America had also learned that the Winter Soldier was actually his friend Bucky Barnes who had been brainwashed by HYDRA for decades, following Barnes's apparent death in 1945.<br>

Once Fury and his allies had stopped Project Insight and also killed Pierce, <strong>Fury chose to go into hiding to continue hunting down the remaining HYDRA cells</strong>. Fury then assisted the now resurrected Phil Coulson in defeating John Garrett while also stopping his plans for <em>Project Deathlok</em>. Following this, Fury chose to promote Coulson to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., telling him to rebuild it from the ground up.
