<p>Full name: Anthony Edward Stark<br>
Species: Human<br>
Citizenship: American<br>

Alias:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>The New kid</li>
        <li>Visionary</li>

Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a <strong>billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the <em>Avengers</em>, and the former CEO of Stark Industries</strong>. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the <em>Ten Rings</em> in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as <em>Obadiah Stane</em> who turned against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, <strong>publicly revealing himself as Iron Man</strong>.<br>
    
Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own <em>Arc Reactor</em> poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by <em>Ivan Vanko</em> who attempted to destroy his legacy. Due to their assistance in both these battles, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a <strong>consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology</strong> while he began a relationship with <em>Pepper Potts</em>. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the <em>Chitauri</em> and <em>Loki</em>. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the <em>Iron Legion</em> to safeguard the world and help him retire.<br>

The 2012 <em>"Mandarin"</em> terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding <em>Aldrich Killian</em> as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, almost losing Pepper Potts in the process. In the wake of the battle, Stark destroyed all of his armors with the <em>Clean Slate Protocol</em>. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on <em>HYDRA</em>, <strong>Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of <em>Wolfgang von Strucker</em> and acquiring Loki's Scepter</strong>.<br>

  Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by <em>Wanda Maximoff's</em> mind games, built <em>Ultron</em> with the help of <em>Bruce Banner</em> as a <strong>new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire</strong>. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost.<br>
  
After the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support <em>the Sokovia Accords</em>. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally <em>Captain America</em> when the latter began protecting the fugitive <em>Winter Soldier</em>, igniting <em>the Avengers Civil War</em>. <strong>The end result left the Avengers in complete disarray</strong>, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide <em>Spider-Man</em> into becoming a better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.<br>

  In 2018, when <em>Thanos</em> and <em>the Black Order</em> invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the <em>six Infinity Stones</em>, Stark, <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on <em>Titan</em> with the help of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the <em>Time Stone</em> for Stark's life. After the Snap, <strong>Stark and <em>Nebula</em> remained the sole survivors on Titan</strong>. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by <em>Captain Marvel</em>, who brought them back to Earth.<br>
  
In the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a daughter, <em>Morgan Stark</em>. <strong>When Stark discovered the key to travel through time, he rejoined the Avengers to undo the Snap</strong>, traveling back in time to retrieve the Scepter and then to regain the <em>Tesseract</em>. During the Battle of Earth, Stark heroically sacrificed himself to eliminate Thanos and his armies, who traveled through time to collect the Infinity Stones, saving the universe from decimation, and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered superheroes.</p>

<h3>War Machine</h3>

<p>Full name: James Rupert Rhodes<br>
Species: Human<br>
Citizenship: American<br>
DOB: 06/10/1968<br>
DOD: still alive<br>
Alias:<br>
 <ul>
  <li>Rhoey</li>   
  <li>Iron Patriot</li>
  <li>Honey Bear</li>
  <li>Platypus</li>
  <li>The Patriot</li>
 </ul>    
Colonel James Rupert "Rhodey" Rhodes is an officer with the <em>United States Air Force</em> and liaison between the military in <em>the Department of Acquisitions and Stark Industries</em>, where he became close friends with Tony Stark. When Stark had been kidnapped by the Ten Rings, <strong>Rhodes personally led a mission to rescue his best friend</strong>. However, upon their return, Rhodes saw Stark moving away from developing his weapons for the military and soon discovered that he was instead focusing on becoming a hero known as Iron Man. Despite all of his fears for his friend's safety, <strong>Rhodes still joined Iron Man in bringing down Obadiah Stane's schemes</strong>, while trying to keep Stark's secrets, only for Stark to reveal them to the media himself.<br>
    
With Iron Man's identity known, Rhodes found himself under pressure from <em>the United States Congress</em> and the military to take possession of the armor for himself, something that he was against. However, as Stark's reckless behavior got even worse, Rhodes had no choice but to take <em>the Mark II armour</em> before handing it over to the military, with <em>Justin Hammer</em> upgrading it with his new weapons to rebrand Rhodes as <em>War Machine</em>. However, just when War Machine was being presented to the world, <strong>Ivan Vanko returned and attacked the Stark Expo with an army of <em>Hammer Drones</em></strong>, as War Machine teamed up with Iron Man to bring him down, resulting in Rhodes keeping the armor for himself, despite Stark's continued objections.<br>

 With his newest armor, Rhodes took on the identity of the <em>Iron Patriot</em> and worked directly for <em>President Matthew Ellis</em>, with a mission to track down the Mandarin. However, <strong>Rhodes had soon discovered that the Mandarin was in fact a ruse created by Aldrich Killian</strong> by hiring actor <em>Trevor Slattery</em> to portray the role, as Killian managed to capture Rhodes and steal the Iron Patriot Armor, as Killian's henchman, <em>Eric Savin</em>, then used it to kidnap President Ellis as part of his ongoing Mandarin ruse. Rhodes managed to free himself and teamed up with Stark to defeat Killian's army of <em>Extremis Soldiers</em> and save President Ellis before Killian could publicly execute him, as Rhodes also uncovered <em>Vice President Rodriguez</em>'s role in Killian's plan.<br>
 
As War Machine, <strong>Rhodes continued serving his country and assisted the Avengers with defeating Ultron</strong>, as War Machine played a key role in ensuring that the people of <em>Sokovia</em> were rescued before Ultron could cause mass extinction. However, Rhodes soon found himself in conflict with the Avengers as the debate over the Sokovia Accords led to Captain America and Iron Man disagreeing and War Machine choosing to side with the government in support of the Accords. As the conflict worsened, War Machine clashed with Captain America's allies while they tried to protect the Winter Soldier and expose the plans of <em>Helmut Zemo</em>, only for War Machine to be crippled as he had been inadvertently shot out of the sky by <em>Vision</em>.<br>

Having been given leg braces by Tony Stark to help him walk again, Rhodes had became disillusioned by the government and decided to disobey <em>Thaddeus Ross</em>'s orders and instead assisted Steve Rogers as they had learned of the impending invasion of the Mad Titan, Thanos and his Black Order. Once they traveled to <em>Wakanda</em> in order to protect the <em>Mind Stone</em> from Thanos, <strong>War Machine fought alongside his allies in their attempts to hold back the Black Order and their own army of <em>Outriders</em></strong>. However, as Thanos arrived himself, War Machine and the others were unable to defeat him as Thanos took the Mind Stone and caused the Snap, as War Machine had then watched on helplessly while trillions of lives were erased.<br>

Determined to undo Thanos' actions, <strong>War Machine joined the Avengers to <em>the Garden</em></strong>, as they discovered that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, prompting Thor to behead the Mad Titan. However, by 2023, the Avengers learned to travel through time and War Machine joined Nebula on a mission to take the <em>Power Stone</em> from <em>Morag</em> in 2014. Succeeding in the mission, the Avengers reversed the Snap, before then being attacked by a past version of Thanos and his entire armies of the Chitauri and Outriders. War Machine then joined his fellow heroes in battling Thanos until Tony Stark sacrificed his life to finally eliminate Thanos, as Rhodes stayed by his best friend's side during his final moments before attending his funeral.</p>

<p>Full name: Virginia Potts<br>
Species: Human<br>
Citizenship: American<br>
DOB: Febuary<br>

<li>Pinhead</li>

</ul>
Virginia "Pepper" Potts is the CEO of <em>Stark Industries</em>. Originally working as <strong>Tony Stark's personal assistant, she would take care of his schedule and perform any task he wished</strong>. During this time, Potts became good friends with Stark and soon, they had begun developing romantic feelings for each other. However, neither was able to act on these feelings, as they each feared that the other would not accept them.<br>
    
When Stark returned from captivity in <em>Afghanistan</em>, <strong>Potts was trusted enough by him to see his Iron Man suits and his workshop</strong>. She helped Stark defeat Obadiah Stane, who tried to kill Stark, by overloading the Arc Reactor, killing Stane. After Stane's death, Stark made Potts his new business partner, taking Stane's place. Believing his death was imminent, Stark stepped down as CEO and appointed her as his replacement. After Stark defeated <em>Whiplash</em> at <em>the Stark Expo</em>, both Potts and Stark finally admitted their attraction to each other and began a romantic relationship.<br>
During the crisis surrounding the Mandarin's terrorist attacks, Potts was kidnapped by Aldrich Killian and injected with <em>Extremis</em>. She was freed by Stark during the Battle on the Norco and went on to kill Killian herself. Stark cured her of the effects of Extremis, who temporarily gave up being Iron Man just for her.<br>

As the War on HYDRA began, <strong>the Avengers needed to be remobilized. Without <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> active to run the team</strong>, Stark took over, allowing Captain America to retain field and team leadership while he designed everything else, including creating new armors and rejoining the team himself as an active duty combatant. Sometime after the Ultron Offensive, he and Potts broke off their relationship, which affected Stark and left him wondering why he could not make it work while his father could.<br>

However, shortly after the Avengers Civil War ended, Stark and Potts resumed their relationship, where Stark eventually proposed to her. <strong>The two married following the Snap and had a daughter, Morgan Stark</strong>. The three of them resided on the Stark Residence until Stark departed for <em>the Time Heist</em>. Later, Potts joined the Avengers in <em>the Battle of Earth</em> as <em>Rescue</em>, wearing <em>the Mark XLIX armor</em>, when Thanos' forces invaded. After Stark died by her side, Potts was present at his funeral, where she set adrift Stark's first Arc Reactor onto a wreath into their residential lakeside.</p>

Obadiah Stane was the business partner of Tony Stark and a good friend of his father, <em>Howard Stark</em>. After Howard's death, <strong>Stane became interim CEO of Stark Industries until Tony took over officially shortly after</strong>. Stane's jealousy of the younger Stark led him to join forces with the Ten Rings to organize a failed attempt to assassinate him so Stane could become CEO once again. <strong>He further armed the Ten Rings with Stark Industries weapons</strong>, to facilitate their campaign in the war-torn <em>Gulmira</em>. When his involvement with terrorists was exposed by Pepper Potts, Stane created the <em>Iron Monger Armor</em> and attempted to kill Stark himself, leading to his own death.</p>
